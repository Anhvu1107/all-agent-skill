# AWT — AI-Powered E2E Testing (Beta)

## Selective Reading Rule

Start with:

- `references/senior-master-standard.md`
- `references/usage-routing.md`
- `references/quality-checklist.md`

Then load only the inherited docs, scripts, assets, or examples that match the user's actual task.

AWT gives AI coding tools the ability to see and interact with web applications through a real browser. Your AI designs YAML test scenarios; AWT executes them with Playwright.

## When to Use
- You need AI-assisted end-to-end testing through a real browser with declarative YAML scenarios.
- The test flow depends on visual matching, OCR, or platform auto-detection instead of stable DOM selectors.
- You want an E2E toolchain that can both execute tests and explain failures for AI coding workflows.

## What works now
- YAML scenarios → Playwright with human-like interaction
- Visual matching: OpenCV template + OCR (no CSS selectors needed)
- Platform auto-detection: Flutter, React, Next.js, Vue, Angular, Svelte
- Structured failure diagnosis with investigation checklists
- Learning DB: failure→fix patterns in SQLite
- 5 AI providers: Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, Ollama
- Skill Mode: no extra AI API key needed

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
