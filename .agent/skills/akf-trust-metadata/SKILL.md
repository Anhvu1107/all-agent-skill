# AKF — The AI Native File Format

## Selective Reading Rule

Start with:

- `references/senior-master-standard.md`
- `references/usage-routing.md`
- `references/quality-checklist.md`

Then load only the inherited docs, scripts, assets, or examples that match the user's actual task.

Every photo has EXIF. Every song has ID3. AKF is the native metadata format for AI-generated content.

## When to Use
Use this skill when you need to stamp, inspect, or audit provenance and trust metadata on AI-generated or AI-modified files for compliance, review, or handoff workflows.

## After creating or modifying files

```bash
akf stamp <file> --agent <agent-name> --evidence "<what you did>"
```

Evidence examples:
- "generated from user prompt"
- "refactored existing code"
- "tests pass"
- "docs reviewed"

## Before modifying existing files

```bash
akf read <file>          # Check existing trust metadata
akf inspect <file>       # See detailed trust scores
```

## Compliance auditing

```bash
akf audit <file> --regulation eu_ai_act    # EU AI Act Article 50
akf audit <file> --regulation hipaa         # HIPAA
akf audit <file> --regulation sox           # SOX
akf audit <file> --regulation nist_ai       # NIST AI RMF
```

## Classification

- `--label confidential` for finance/secret/internal paths
- `--label public` for README, docs, examples
- Default: `internal`

## Install

```bash
pip install akf
```

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
