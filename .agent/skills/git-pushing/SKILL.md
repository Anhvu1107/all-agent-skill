# Git Push Workflow

## Selective Reading Rule

Start with:

- `references/senior-master-standard.md`
- `references/usage-routing.md`
- `references/quality-checklist.md`

Then load only the inherited docs, scripts, assets, or examples that match the user's actual task.

Stage all changes, create a conventional commit, and push to the remote branch.

## When to Use
Automatically activate when the user:

- Explicitly asks to push changes ("push this", "commit and push")
- Mentions saving work to remote ("save to github", "push to remote")
- Completes a feature and wants to share it
- Says phrases like "let's push this up" or "commit these changes"

## Workflow

**ALWAYS use the script** - do NOT use manual git commands:

```bash
bash skills/git-pushing/scripts/smart_commit.sh
```

With custom message:

```bash
bash skills/git-pushing/scripts/smart_commit.sh "feat: add feature"
```

Script handles: staging, conventional commit message, Claude footer, push with -u flag.

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
